#### What We Will Try to Do

**Begin** to understand and use Git/GitHub. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You will probably not even feel very comfortable using Git. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Git takes practice.

#### Be Excellent to Each Other

* If you spot someone in the class who is struggling with something and you think you know how to help, please give them a hand. Try not to do the task for them: instead explain the steps they need to take and *what* these steps will achieve.

#### Be Patient With Me and Yourself

* This is a big group, with different levels of knowledge, different computer systems.
* This isn't my full-time job (though if someone wants to pay me to play with computers all day I'd probably accept). I'll do my best to make this session useful.
* This is your session. If you feel we are going too fast, then please put up a pink sticky. We can decide as a group what to cover.
