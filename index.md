#### What We Will Try to Do

**Begin** to understand and use Git/GitHub. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You will probably not even feel very comfortable using Git. This is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Git takes practice. In this lesson we use Git from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell is expected, but is not mandatory.

#### Be Excellent to Each Other

- If you spot someone in the class who is struggling with something and you think you know how to help, please give them a hand. Try not to do the task for them: instead explain the steps they need to take and *what* these steps will achieve.

#### Be Patient With The Instructor and Yourself

- This is a big group, with different levels of knowledge, different computer systems.
- This isn't your instructor's full-time job (though if someone wants to pay them to play with computers all day they'd probably accept). They will do their best to make this session useful.
- This is your session. If you feel we are going too fast, then please put up a pink sticky. We can decide as a group what to cover.
