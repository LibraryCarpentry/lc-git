- [Tower client git cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)

`git init`
: create a new local git repository

`git status`
: view the status of your files in the working directory and staging area

`git add`
: tell git to start tracking a file, or a series of files

`git commit`
: save file changes from the staging area permanently to the project history

`git push`
: upload all commits to a remote repository, such as GitHub

`git log`
: show history of commits in reverse chronological order

`git diff`
: show changes made to tracked files

`git pull`
: download upstream changes and merge them into your local repository

`git remote add origin`
: add a remote repository named 'origin', to upload changes to or download changes from

## Further reading

- The [help pages](https://help.github.com/) of GitHub are a good place to start
- GitHub has '[activities](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)' which aim to explain how git works
- GitHub also has interactive tutorials for their [online version (Learning Labs)](https://lab.github.com/) and for [using Git offline (Git-It)](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron#git-it-desktop-app)
- Atlassian has in depth but clear [tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) on using git
- The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org) uses GitHub to manage lessons useful to historians and also people working in libraries. It is a useful resource for lessons but also to see GitHub in action.
