- GitHub has '[activities](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)' which aim to explain how git works
- GitHub also has interactive tutorials for their [online version (GitHub Skills)](https://skills.github.com/) and for [using Git offline (Git-It)](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron#git-it-desktop-app)
- Atlassian has in depth but clear [tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) on using git
- The [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org) uses GitHub to manage lessons useful to historians and also people working in libraries. It is a useful resource for lessons but also to see GitHub in action.
