## Creating a GitHub Account

You will need an account for [GitHub](https://github.com) to follow this lesson.

1. Go to <https://github.com> and follow the "Sign up" link at the top-right of the window.
2. Follow the instructions to create an account.
3. Verify your email address with GitHub.
4. Configure multifactor authentication (see below).

### Multi-factor Authentication

In 2023, GitHub introduced a requirement for 
all accounts to have 
[multi-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication) 
configured for extra security.
Several options exist for setting up 2FA, which are summarised here:

1. If you already use an authenticator app, 
   like [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&oco=0) 
   or [Duo Mobile](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app) on your smartphone for example, 
   [add GitHub to that app](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-totp-mobile-app).
2. If you have access to a smartphone but do not already use an authenticator app, install one and 
   [add GitHub to the app](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-totp-mobile-app).
3. If you do not have access to a smartphone or do not want to install an authenticator app, you have two options:
    1. [set up 2FA via text message](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-text-messages) 
       ([list of countries where authentication by SMS is supported](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/countries-where-sms-authentication-is-supported)), or
    2. [use a hardware security key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication#configuring-two-factor-authentication-using-a-security-key) 
       like [Youbikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) 
       or the [Google Titan key](https://store.google.com/us/product/titan_security_key?hl=en-US&pli=1).

The GitHub documentation provides [more details about configuring 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).
